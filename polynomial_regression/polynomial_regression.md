# Polynomial Linear Regression

Let $b_0, b_1 ... b_n \in \mathbb{R}$ be the coefficients 
Let $x_1$ be the independant variable

Equation for polynomial regression:

$$y = b_0+b_1x_1 + b_2x_1^2 + ... + b_nx_1^n$$

- Can you express your equation as a **linear** combination of all the $b_0, b_1, ... b_n$ coefficients?
